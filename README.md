# NewsApp (The Guardian):

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout my career path. They include:

● Connecting to The Guardian news API with *Retrofit* (was handling calling the API by hand and used Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL).
● Parsing the *JSON* response with *Gson*.
● Used *Paging* library to load and display small chunks of data at a time.
● Displayed the images with *Picasso*. 
● Handling error cases gracefully.
● Updating information regularly.
● Using *RxJava* for background operations (was using an *AsyncTask*).
● Doing network operations independent of the *Activity lifecycle*.
● Implement the *Preference* Fragment for user's preferred choices - Update and display the Preference Summary.
● Launch a Settings Activity from a menu in all activities.
● Used *Room* db and *Architecture Components* to save some articles.
● Managed to write *Clean code*.
● Start to apply Dependency injection with *Dagger2*. 

Really I will appreciate any feedback or suggestions :)
If you like it, don't forget to give it a star please ;)
